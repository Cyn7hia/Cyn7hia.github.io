Hi, I am Luyao ZHU, a 4-th year PhD candidate at School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, under the supervision of Dr. [Erik Cambria](http://www.sentic.net/erikcambria/). I obtained my M.S. in management science and engineering from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2019. Before that, I received my B.Sc. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics and B.Ec. in Econimics from China University of Political Science and Law in 2016. 

The multiple education backgrounds in different majors enable me to quickly adapt to a new domain. I am always ready to take on challenges, advancing the frontiers of knowlege and research. My research interests include: **semi-supervised learning**, **hard negative sampling**, **persona attribute extraction**, and **persona-based dialogue generation**. For more information, please click [publications](/Cyn7hia.github.io/publications/).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
