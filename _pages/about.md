Hi, I am Luyao ZHU, a 4-th year PhD candidate at School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, under the supervision of Dr. [Erik Cambria](http://www.sentic.net/erikcambria/). I obtained my M.S. in management science and engineering from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2019. Before that, I received my B.Sc. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics and B.Ec. in Econimics from China University of Political Science and Law in 2016. 

The multiple education backgrounds in different majors enable me to quickly adapt to a new domain. I am always ready to take on challenges, advancing the frontiers of knowlege and research. My research interests include: **semi-supervised learning**, **hard negative sampling**, **persona attribute extraction**, and **persona-based dialogue generation**. For more information, please click [publications](/publications/). During my spare time, I like drawing and cooking.

<a href='#'> I am on the job market now!<a> Please feel free to drop me an email if you are interested. Thank you. :blush:
